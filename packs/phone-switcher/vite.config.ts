// The rung-3 bundle: a pack ships a BUILT ESM bundle the host loads at
// runtime, so nothing in the app references this pack by name. The externals
// list is the pack's IMPORT contract (doc 68 §9.1 Q1) — exactly the
// specifiers the host's loader resolves, nothing else; trust comes from the
// engine-stamped hash + the install decision, not from this list. Unminified
// on purpose: `dist/` is committed, so it has to stay reviewable. `jsx` is
// pinned explicitly — the committed output must keep the automatic runtime
// (`react/jsx-runtime` is one of the four granted externals).
